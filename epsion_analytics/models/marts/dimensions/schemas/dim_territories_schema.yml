# This file contains the schema for the dim_territories model, which is a dimension table that contains geographic territories.
# It includes attributes used for geographic categorization, such as territory key, continent, region, and country.
# The model is built from the raw data in the territories table and includes additional transformations.
# Some generic tests are applied to ensure data quality, such as not null and unique constraints.
# The dim_territories model is used in various marts and reports to facilitate geographic analysis and reporting.
