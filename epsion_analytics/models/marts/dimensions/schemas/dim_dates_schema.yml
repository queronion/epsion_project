# This file contqains the schema for the dim_dates model, which is a rolling-play dimension table that contains one row for each calendar date.
# It includes attributes used for time-based reporting, such as year, quarter, month, day, and weekday/weekend indicators.
# The model is built from the raw data in the dates table and includes additional transformations to create a comprehensive date dimension.
# Some generic tests are applied to ensure data quality, such as not null and unique constraints.
# The dim_dates model is used in various marts and reports to facilitate time-based analysis and reporting.
