# This file contains the schema for the dim_products model, which is a dimension table that contains detailed information about individual products.
# It includes attributes such as product key, name, SKU, model name, size, color, style, description, subcategory key, price, and cost.
# The model is built from the raw data in the products table and includes additional transformations.
# Some generic tests are applied to ensure data quality, such as not null and unique constraints.
# The model also includes specific tests for price and cost to ensure they are within acceptable ranges.
# The model is used for product analysis, sales reporting
