# This file contains the schema for the dim_subcategories model, which is a dimension table that contains subcategories of products.
# It includes attributes used for product categorization, such as subcategory key, subcategory name, and category key.
# The model is built from the raw data in the subcategories table and includes additional transformations.
# Some generic tests are applied to ensure data quality, such as not null and unique constraints.
# The dim_subcategories model is used in various marts and reports to facilitate product categorization and analysis.
